This repository consits codes for Facial Detecton Using MTCNN library. There are two codes in this repository :

1. Facial Detection in Images. This code is capable of detecting a single face or multiple faces in Images.
2. Facial Detection in Video. This code is capable of detecting a single face or multiple faces in a video feed.

For Detailed explanation of the code and to build an understanding of MTCNN in the simplest way possible you can head on to our blogs on Medium which are divided into three parts: 

1. [Facial Detection Using MTCNN (Part 1)](https://medium.com/@dummykoders/face-detection-using-mtcnn-part-1-c35c4ad9c542): This blog goes on to explain in the simplest way possible concepts revolving around facial detection and tries to explain and answer questions such as, What is facial detection?, What is CNN? and What is MTCNN?

2. [Facial Detection Using MTCNN (Part 2)](https://medium.com/@dummykoders/face-detection-using-mtcnn-part-2-d3db8abf3047): This blog gives a good explanation on the installation process and the follow along code tutorial to implement facial detection. 

3. Facial Detection Using MTCNN (Part 3) : This blog tries to explain in detail the MTCNN working based on the technical paper in the simplest way possible (coming soon).
